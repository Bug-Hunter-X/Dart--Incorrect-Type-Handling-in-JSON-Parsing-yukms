# Dart: Incorrect Type Handling in JSON Parsing

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart when handling JSON responses from APIs.  The `bug.dart` file contains code that fails if the JSON response doesn't conform to the expected structure. The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a corrected version with proper type checking and error handling.
